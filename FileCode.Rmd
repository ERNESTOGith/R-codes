**1.BASICS OF R**

***1.1 Calculating***
```{r}
#The square root of 256
sqrt(256)

#Calculate the cumulative sum of the numbers 2,3,4,5,6.
cumsum(c(2, 3, 4, 5, 6))

#Calculate the cumulative sum of those numbers, but in reverse order.
cumsum(rev(c(2, 3, 4, 5, 6)))

# Find 10 random numbers between 0 and 100, rounded to the nearest whole number.
sample(0:100, 10)

round(runif(10, 0, 100))
```

***1.2 Simple objects***
```{r}
#These codes assign numbers to objects x and y
x <- 10
y <- 20
#Calculate the product of x and y
x * y

#Store the result in a new object called z
z <- x * y
z

#Inspect your workspace by typing ls(), and by clicking the Environment tab in Rstudio, and find the three objects you created
ls()

#Make a vector of the objects x, y and z. Use this command
myvec <- c(x,y,z)

#Find the minimum, maximum, length, and variance of myvec.
min(myvec)
max(myvec)
length(myvec)
var(myvec)

#Remove the myvec object from your workspace
rm(myvec)
```
